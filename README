How to Build the VP7 W.K.P.
---------------------------

As you might have noticed, the VP7 W.K.P. does not (yet) support 
the standard building method (configure, make, make install).

There is a simple Makefile though. To build the program, just type
"make". If you have Gtk installed all
right, it should compile without problems. The created binary is 
placed in the main directory containing the package.

The "data" directory contains some predefined radioactive sources.
You should edit the "vp7wkp.cfg" file to contain a list of sources
that you want to load when the program starts.

Sorry for this primitive way things work, but this program is still
under development with a somehow low priority.
If you feel that this is a program, that might become usefull to you
in one way or other, tell us and we might revise our priority list.
