	* data/: added patch #418661.
	
2001-04-24; Alexandru Csete <alexc@ifa.au.dk>
	* vp7wkp.cfg: path to sources fixed (bug #418646).
	
2001-04-16; 0.4.4 by Niels Bassler <bassler@vp7.dk>
	* src/counter.c: bugfix regarding state of power button.
	Some minor implementation improvements.
	* src/main.c: fixed warning when compiling wKp.
	* pixmaps/: minor changes in some pixmaps.

2001-03-22; 0.4.3 by Niels Bassler <bassler@vp7.dk>

	Bugfix regarding the last digit, when in
	activity mode. Bugfix regarding some rounding errors.
	The counter now supports 64-bit integers internally
	and "new_counts" may now be 32-bit integers.
	Default state of counter can be defined in counter.h
	Internal timer added (is working exact, and makes the
	counter more generic).
	* src/main.c: The "real" time is passed to the "dodecay" function.
	* pixmaps/: new digits for counter and a more generic 
	unit for the [activity] mode.
	
2001-02-06; 0.4.2 by Alexandru Csete <alex@vp7.dk>
	* pixmaps/: Led pixmaps made transparent
	* src/: Some perfomance fixes.
	
2001-01-20; 0.4.1 by Alexandru Csete <alex@vp7.dk>
	* Makefile: Modified compiler options to compile OK
	with unofficial gcc shipped with Red Hat 7.0
	* vp7wkp-0.4.*/: Directory structure modified a bit
	* README: File created containing some installation
	instructions.
	
2000-08-11; 0.4 by Alexandru Csete <alex@vp7.dk>
	* src/shield.c: is fully implemented including possibility to
	adjust distance between source and detector.
	* src/shield.c: set_* renamed to toggle_*
	* src/shield.c: gtk_widget_show( children ) -> gtk_widget_show_all( parent )
	* src/shield.c: Packing has been changed from h/v boxes to a table.
	* src/source.c: gtk_widget_show( children ) -> gtk_widget_show_all( parent )
	
2000-06-19; 0.3.7 by Alexandru Csete <alex@vp7.dk>

	* src/shield.c: Range calculation of beta particles in Al
	has been implemented. The thickness of the Al shield is
	currently set to 1mm but will soon be implemented as 
	user definable. Pb absorbes beta particles completely.

2000-06-03; 0.3.6 by Alexandru Csete <alex@vp7.dk>

	* src/shield.c: Paper implemented (it absorbes alpha
	particles completely. Alpha particles are also absorbed
	if Al or Pb shields are set. Range calculation of alpha
	particles in air is also implemented. The distance
	between the source and detector is set to 1mm but will
	soon be implemented as user definable.

	* docs/*: Contains some scattered documents.
	
2000-06-01; 0.3.4 by Alexandru Csete <alex@vp7.dk>

	* src/shield.c: New remote controls added for shields.

	* src/cbox.c: Has been completely removed as well as the
	dependecies from the other files.

	* src/mca.c: aka. Multi Channel Analyser - what every nuclear
	physicist dream of - has been created but not implemented.
	It displays a nice pixmap though.

	
2000-05-17; 0.3.1 by Alexandru Csete <alex@vp7.dk>

	Following changes made as first step in implementing
	shields and deleting cbox:
	
	* src/gfx.c: shield drawing callback functions modified
	so that they take an integer as parameter (shield
	set/not set) instead of a pointer.

	* src/source.c: does not use cbox anymore

	* src/cbox.c: modified to do the callback in gfx.c with
	correct parameters. The source setting callbacks have
	been removed as they have become obsolete from version
	0.3.0.
	

2000-04-26; 0.3.0 by Alexandru Csete <alex@vp7.dk>

	* src/source.c: Has now place for 10 sources. The source
	data are read from .src files in the ./sources/
	directory. See the src_format.txt file for more
	information.
	The sources are placed in buttons.
	
	
2000-04-25; 0.2.0 by The VP7 Programming Team <software@vp7.dk>

	* skab.c: Has been removed and the functions moved to
	source.c.

	* source.c: Completely rewritten to give more realistic
	decay (with energies). The other modules have been
	modified to be compatible with the new datastructures.

	* *.xpm: Moved to a separate directory ./pixmaps/


2000-04-05; 0.1.2 by Alexandru Csete <alex@vp7.dk>

	* source.c: Added some randomness to the decay. Far from
	completed! 

	* myrandom.c: initmyrandom() fixed; works properly
	* main.c: Now uses initmyrandom() and a global timestep var

	
1999-12-19; 0.1.1 by Alexandru Csete <alex@vp7.dk>

	* ledbox.c: Added some fancy blinking leds but not final.

	* main.c has got the "Sellafield" video camera connection
	removed, which has been added to ledbox.


	
1999-12-15; 0.1.0 The VP7 Programming Team <software@vp7.dk>

	* All modules compiled and linked. The program is functional
	and has been demonstrated.

	* shield.c: Shields are not implemented.
        
	* source.c: The decay is not random but follows a theoretical
	exponential decay.
