                         The Anatomy of an .src File

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



1. Introduction

This document describes the .src file format, which is used by the vp7wkp
program to obtain information about the radioactive nuclei. We hope that it
will help you with "designing" your own radioactive nuclei.
Comments and questions should be sent to Alexandru Csete <alex@vp7.dk>.



2. What Do You Need?

I order to create a new (realistic) radioactive material, you need to know

  * the mass in atomic mass units (1 amu = 1.6606e-27 kg)
  * the half life in seconds
  * the (major) decay modes with energies and branching ratios
  * 60x60 pixels .xpm file (preferably two files) 

Example:

  Nucleus              Half life                Decay modes
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Carbon 14      5570 years (1.76e11 sec)       beta (100%) 0.158 MeV
  Potassium 42   12.4 hours (44640 sec)         beta (82%) 3.55 MeV
                                                beta (18%) 2.03 MeV
                                                gamma (18%) 1.52 MeV


From the example you see, that Carbon 14 only has one decay mode, while
Potassium 42 has two modes (beta) and one of them is a decay to an
excited state, which also decays by emission of a gamma quantum.
Many radioactive nuclei have many more decay modes, but there is only
room for 3 alpha, 3 beta and 3 gamma modes. We found this sufficient for
most radioactive nuclei. You won't get much out of a decay mode with a
branching ratio of 0.1% or less...

You can of course make up some random modes, masses and half lifes to
play around.

The .xpm file(s) are used to represent the material in the user interface
of the program. You will need two pixmaps: One "off" pixmap and one "on"
pixmap. The included "off" pixmaps are actually just some greyscale copies
of the "on" pixmaps. There is a sample for each: radion.xpm and radiof.xpm,
you can use these so you don't have to start from scratch.
If the file(s) you specify does not exist, a default pixmap will be displayed
instead.



3. The .src File Anatomy

The first line in the file is the name of the nucleus. It may contain up to
30 characters. Please, don't use escape codes or sequences. It will probably
make the program look and behave weird.

The second line contains the filename of the "on" pixmap and the third line
contains the filename of the "off" pixmap. These filenames can be identical
but you have to include both lines!

The fourth line contains the mass of the nucleus in atomic mass units (amu),
the amount (weight) of the material you have in grams and the half life in
seconds. These three numbers should be separated with blank (other separators
will probably work, but use them at your own risk).
If you have 1 micro-gram Plutonium 239 this line would look like:

239.05 1.0e-6 7.66e11


After the fourth line follow the decay modes. There are nine lines: 3 alpha,
3 beta and 3 gamma. Each line has to contain the energy in MeV and the
branching ratio separated with blanks. If the nucleus concerned has less modes
 than there is space to, you have to fill it with zeroes. For our beloved
plutonium it is (three alpha and one gamma):

5.15 0.72
5.12 0.17
5.10 0.11
0.0 0.0
0.0 0.0
0.0 0.0
0.013 0.17
0.0 0.0
0.0 0.0


After the last line you can write some additional text which will be shown
in the toolbox window.

So the complete file for plutonium 239 becomes:

Plutonium 239 (Pu239)
pu239on.xpm
pu239off.xpm
239.05 1.0e-6 7.66e11
5.15 0.72
5.12 0.17
5.10 0.11
0.0 0.0
0.0 0.0
0.0 0.0
0.013 0.17
0.0 0.0
0.0 0.0
Here comes any additional information you might want
to add to your own sourcefile.


If you are in doubt of anything, take a look at the included .src files. They
won't bite you.
GOOD LUCK with designing your radioactive nuclei!!!!
